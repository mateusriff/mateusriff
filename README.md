## Hello, world! I'm @mateusriff

Games introduced me at a very young age to the world of tech and it has been a part of me ever since.

I started learning the basics of programming on [**Scratch**](https://scratch.mit.edu/) back when I was 13. As I grew older, I went on to learn actual programmnig languages, such as **Python** and the ones I use most today as a Full-Stack developer: **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** (with React and React Native).

Currently, **I'm learning C** to get the fundamentals straight.
